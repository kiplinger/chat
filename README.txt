The simple php comment system!

There are 2 given styles, or you could just create your own 
by using them as a template(The script uses style.css).

The main script is the index.php. Inside there are 2 blocks of php code. 
The first one controls posting, the seccond the displaying of the comments.
In the middle is a block of html code. This is the box where you submit your comment.
The first block of php code and the html code in the middle work together,
so one needs to redirect to the other. This can be inserted anywhere
The seccond block of php code works by itself, so you can copy it anywhere into your page.

Everything in the index.php file is commented,
so you can easily find what you need to change and change it.

If you change locations of these scripts, make sure the $file variable points to the text file that
contains the comments.
